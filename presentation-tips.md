## Slides
* For every slide and each item on your slide, ask yourself: what was the motivation to include it? What’s the “take-away”? 
* Avoid “blocks of text” on the slide. Use short / concise bullet points (no more than 5-6 per slide) with enough spacing between them.
* Be mindful of the slide headings -- make them informative. E.g., if your slide is titled “User” and the slide describes “User Actions”, the latter is a more informative heading.
*  Screenshots of database tables are not as informative as a diagram could be; e.g., diagrams visually show connection between various attributes.
*  When including screenshots /  images / diagrams make it easy for the audience to see/read the content of the figures. You can circle, highlight or otherwise draw attention to the relevant elements (see the comment about color).
*  When using graphs, make sure to label your axes, include a readable legend, and provide an informative caption.
* Live demos are usually tricky. Technical glitches could be avoided by testing the exact demo walkthrough in advance, and then freezing the master branch until the presentation is over. + you can create an effective functionality/diagram walk-through using step-by-step animations (they can guide audience’s attention to the appropriate section of the slide).


* Watch out for typos/misspellings!  Spell-check your slides!
Make every bullet point begin with the same part of speech (e.g., an action verb) -- such consistency makes it easier to read/digest the slides.
*  Avoid dark text on dark background (same goes for light text on light background). Take into account that, generally, projectors seem to make dark colors even darker while lighter colors appear even lighter. Be mindful that what you see on the computer screen is not how the slide might be displayed. 
*  Check the slides to make sure they are displayed correctly.
* Bonus tip: try out the slides in the room where you will be presenting, preferably, using the presentation computer, before your actual presentation. Leave yourself enough time to make the necessary changes based on what you learn from that test.
*  If using color-coding, be careful not to use red/green as distinguishing colors, because red/green color-blindness is quite common (color-blind people see distinct colors, e.g., red and green, as being indistinguishable from each other).


*  “Thank you! Questions? … ” as the last slide is not informative -- including an overview/major feature highlights on the last slide is more helpful (and can help you address the audience’s questions without having to scroll through slides).
* Including “Possible Questions” on the last slide can provide a starting point and/or help your audience formulate their questions.
* Bonus tip: include an Appendix with the helpful slides that you might bring up during the Q&A.
*  Plan how to wrap-up your presentation: don’t just end it abruptly. You could, for example, go over the major highlights/achievements of your work to remind the audience of the contributions that you described (which you could add on the final slide).

## Style
* Find an engaging start to the presentation: asking the audience a question, adding an anecdote or an illustrative example. 
Be creative but also be respectful!
* Be aware of your non-verbal actions as they can be a bit distracting and give away your nervousness (which can be translated as the lack of preparation).
* It’s never good to be surprised by your own slides (and/or their animations). Make sure to rehearse the full flow of your talk.
*  Rehearse the presentation at least a couple of times to practice the logical flow of slide progression and timing. Practicing will help you figure out transitions between the slides, which might minimize stuttering along with the number of “uhm”s and other filler words during the talk. 
* Rehearsing might also help eliminate the need to repeatedly look at the projector/computer screen --> make eye contact with the audience.
Looking directly at the audience can be unnerving, so you use a few tricks to help you with your presentation delivery: e.g., face the audience but you don’t have to look directly at people, and instead, select a few spots in the room, near the audience.

* Having pauses in the presentation is OK, since it gives the audience a chance to take in the information and follow you better. 
The slower speaking speed creates the impression of monotonous speaking. Slightly picking up the pace of your delivery might make your presentation even more engaging.


## Notes

Introduction is the easiest part to rehearse to get a great start to your presentation -- don’t skip over it. 

For databases:
Simply describing what is stored in each table quickly loses the audience, since they can read it off of the slide. Explain the motivation and the reasoning for selecting it, what it enables you to do.
For functionality:
Simply describing what the user does, and what the next step is, and what they do next, and so on and so forth, quickly loses the audience. Using planned transitions between different parts of the slide and subsequent slides (and maybe making them part of a story) would bring your content to life, help you enhance the motivation behind the features you are introducing, and engage your audience.

Usually, people put too much text on the slides! Making the bullet points more concise would be helpful -- you don’t need full sentences.
Text on the figures and on the slides should be much bigger to make it easier to read. Enlarging the font will also help eliminate too much text from the slides. 

The last slide could be more informative instead of listing generic headings for an outline of a talk: e.g., you could include a major takeaway or 2-3 highlights of your talk, show the diagram of your system, or anything else that could help your audience ask questions and/or help you answer them.
